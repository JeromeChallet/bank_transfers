1. added comments for each line to see what each one does.

2. should more depedencies need to be instantited without a factory class we can use a setUp method to run before all of the tests
normally i would remove the line from the related test function but I left it there to save you time so you can see more quickly what I did.

    protected FinalResult $f;

    protected function setUp() :void{
        $this->f = new FinalResult();
    }
3. browser testing is unnecessary in this case. it is more consuming to begin with and can be implemented later in a seprate testing file should the need arises.

4. I believe continous integration should be used especialy working with agile method. when working with clients, they want things to work firts and foremost. plus it is always good practice to 
have one working element than a dozen buggy ones. Github Actions is a good choice for that.

5. I did not modify the FinalResult.php itself beside commenting. I guess I could do so in order to check every single Array element individually in different classes. But I do not see any arm in comparing as a whole the cvs document. It even checks whether or not the field is empty and if it has reached the end.

6.I also do not need to add a function checking if fields are missing since ternary operators assign a value if necessary.

7. I was thinking of making a dummy but there is only one necessary function.
